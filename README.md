## Models:

1. [Set Covering Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set\_cover\_problem): Solved in Python using following approaches:
- MIP model using pyomo
- MIP model using Google OR-tools
- Lagrange Relaxation method with some modification as discussed in : Beasley, John E. "A lagrangian heuristic for set‚Äêcovering problems." Naval Research Logistics (NRL) 37.1 (1990): 151-164.
